**`Library/IGF/A015.pdf` (`Submission Guideline - Alchemy Archive`)**:
    *   **Relevance:** As a meta-document from the Inner Garden Foundation (IGF), this guideline provides crucial context for the project's library. It details the rigorous, academic, and disciplined methodology used to collect, preserve, and categorize the alchemical texts that form a large part of this project's research base. It validates the source material by showing it is part of a serious, structured, and collaborative effort among practicing alchemists, not a random assortment of files.
    *   **Key Contributions:**
        *   **Archival Rigor:** The document specifies the use of professional archival standards, including MARC 21 for metadata and the UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) for file naming. It mandates the use of long-term preservation formats like PDF/A. This demonstrates a commitment to treating esoteric knowledge with the same rigor as academic and scientific material, aligning with the Unified Hermetic Framework's goal of bridging these domains.
        *   **Collaborative and Ethical Framework:** It outlines a tiered access system based on contribution, framing the archive as a collective "labour of love." It also includes provisions for restricted access based on donor requirements, showing a nuanced and ethical approach to the dissemination of potentially sensitive information.
        *   **Project Validation:** By revealing the methodical and serious nature of the IGF's work, this document lends credibility to the source texts themselves. It confirms that the research materials used in this project are curated by a community of dedicated practitioners, which strengthens the foundation upon which the Unified Hermetic Framework is built. The emphasis on "Ora, Lege, Lege, Lege, Relege, Labora et Invenies" (Pray, Read, Read, Read, Re-read, Work and Discover) underscores the practical, not just theoretical, orientation of the source material.
