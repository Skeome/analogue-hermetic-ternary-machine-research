# Summary of "Submission Guideline - Alchemy Archive" (A015)

This document provides the submission guidelines for the Alchemy Archive, a collective library project by the Inner Garden Foundation. The goal of the archive is to preserve and share alchemical texts among students and researchers.

## Introduction

The document emphasizes the importance of sharing knowledge and preserving rare documents. It highlights that the most time-consuming but crucial part of submitting to the archive is providing accurate metadata, which is the basis for navigating and searching the collection. The archive uses the MARC 21 standard for bibliographic data.

## Metadata and File Formatting

The guideline details several key metadata fields and formatting requirements:

*   **Language [008]:** The language of the document should be specified using the ISO 639-1 standard (e.g., "en" for English).
*   **Preferred Formats [337]:** For long-term preservation, specific file formats are preferred. The primary format for documents is **PDF/A**, an open standard designed for the long-term preservation of electronic documents. It prohibits features like font linking and encryption that could hinder future accessibility. While wholesale migration to PDF/A is not always beneficial, validation tools can be used to increase confidence in a file's long-term readability. For scanned documents, a minimum resolution of 300 dpi is recommended (600 dpi for images and manuscripts), and OCR is encouraged.
*   **Participation and Access [506]:** Access to the archive is based on a tiered system of participation. The more a member contributes, the more they can access. There are "Public" and "Restricted" sections. Restricted access can be based on donor-specified conditions, and a flowchart is provided to determine access restrictions.
*   **Description Note [500]:** The contributor should provide a description of the work's relevance.
*   **Summary [520]:** This field should contain a summary of the scope and general contents of the material.
*   **Ownership and Custodial History [561]:** The history of the document's ownership is important, especially for unique items.
*   **File Name [856]:** The file name should follow a specific format: `UDC-number_Author_Title.extension`. The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is used to classify the subject matter.

## Uploading and Encouragement

The document provides a link for uploading books to the "Curator's Desk" and an email address to notify the curator.

It concludes with a "Closing word of Encouragement" from Moreh, who states that the project is one of the most exciting in his alchemical career and that the archive already contains many profound and rare texts. He emphasizes that access is a function of participation, encouraging students of alchemy to contribute to building one of the finest alchemy libraries in the world.
