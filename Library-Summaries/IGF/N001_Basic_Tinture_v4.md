# Summary of "Inner Garden Alchemy I: Lesson 1 - Basic Tincture" (N001)

This document is the first lesson in the "Inner Garden Alchemy I" course. It provides a practical introduction to the art of Spagyrics, a branch of alchemy focused on creating herbal remedies. The lesson guides the student through the process of making a basic tincture, emphasizing a hands-on approach to learning.

## Introduction

The lesson begins by stating that the Alchemy I course is built on the two pillars of **Theory** and **Practice**. It stresses that practice is paramount, as it allows for an intuitive "feel" for the alchemical processes. The lesson also distinguishes between alchemical/spagyric medicine and modern allopathic medicine, highlighting that spagyric products represent the entire being (essence) of the plant, not just isolated active ingredients.

## First Principles of Alchemy

The lesson introduces the core principles of alchemy:
*   **The Tria Prima (Three Principles):**
    *   **Sulfur (Soul):** Represented by the symbol Sulfur. In the plant kingdom, this is the essential oil.
    *   **Mercury (Spirit):** Represented by the symbol ☿. In the plant kingdom, this is the alcohol (ethanol).
    *   **Salt (Body):** Represented by the symbol  Salt. In the plant kingdom, this is the mineral salts.
*   **The Four Elements:**
    *   **Fire (Δ):** Associated with heat and dryness.
    *   **Water (∇):** Associated with cold and moisture.
    *   **Air (()):** Associated with heat and moisture.
    *   **Earth (∀):** Associated with cold and dryness.

## The Process of Making a Basic Tincture

The lesson provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to creating a tincture, following the alchemical axiom "Solve et Coagula" (Dissolve and Coagulate).

### Required Materials
*   Dried herb of choice (e.g., fennel, rosemary, mint, lemon balm)
*   Two mason jars with lids
*   White brandy or Everclear (menstruum)
*   Distilled water
*   Mortar and pestle
*   Heat-resistant dish (Corningware or Visionware)
*   Heat source (e.g., camping stove)
*   Coffee filters or surgical cotton
*   Funnel
*   Small tincture bottle

### The Seven Traditional Operations (Five covered in this lesson)

1.  **Solution:** The dried herb is ground into a fine powder and then dissolved in a **menstruum** (the solvent, in this case, alcohol). This begins the extraction of the plant's essence.
2.  **Putrefaction (Maceration):** The mixture is hermetically sealed in a jar and left to macerate at a gentle heat (around 40°C) for a "philosophical month" (about 40 days). This allows the alcohol to fully extract the Sulfur (essential oils) from the herb.
3.  **Separation (Distillation):** After maceration, the liquid tincture is carefully filtered from the solid plant matter. The liquid contains the Sulfur and Mercury principles. The remaining solid matter is called the **Caput Mortuum** ("Dead Head").
4.  **Purification (Calcination):** The Caput Mortuum is heated to a high temperature (calcined) to burn away all impurities, leaving behind a white ash. This ash contains the Salt principle. The ashes are then leached with distilled water to extract the soluble salts.
5.  **Cohobation (Coagulation):** The purified, water-soluble Salt is ground into a fine powder and then added back into the filtered tincture. The mixture is then sealed and left to macerate again, allowing the Salt to "marry" with the Sulfur and Mercury. This creates a final product that is a recombination of the three purified principles.

The final two traditional operations, **Fixation** and **Lapidification**, are mentioned but fall outside the scope of this introductory lesson.

## Result and Glossary

The result of this process is a potent spagyric tincture that is safe to ingest. The lesson notes that such a tincture, containing all three principles of the plant, can have effects on the physical and psychic body, such as increased dream activity or intuition.

The document also includes a glossary of terms, defining concepts like **Clyssus** (a preparation from all parts of a plant), **Elixir**, **Essence**, **Extract**, **Magistery**, and **Plant Stone**.
