# Summary of "Calming the Waters" by Br. Shruti

This short document outlines a meditation technique called "Calming the Waters," designed to help process dense emotions like anger and frustration. The author, Br. Shruti, presents it as an exercise for the inner faculties that uses imagination to achieve self-gnosis.

## The Philosophy

The core idea is that chaotic emotions are "pointers" indicating that our beliefs and expectations have been challenged. Through reflection and inner-seeking, these emotions can become "guiding lanterns." The exercise works by externalizing the inner emotional state into an imagined environment and then consciously calming that environment, which in turn calms the inner state.

## The Technique

The exercise is meant to be performed in the moment the emotion is being felt, which is often experienced physically in the solar plexus, stomach, or lower abdomen.

The steps are as follows:
1.  **Preparation:** Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and take a slow, deep breath.
2.  **Attention:** Rest your attention on the physical feeling of the emotion within you.
3.  **Imagination (The Storm):** Imagine yourself in a small boat on a lake during a turbulent storm. The external environment should mirror your internal emotional state. Use your "inner senses" to build the scene:
    *   **See:** Dark clouds.
    *   **Hear:** Crashing waves.
    *   **Smell:** Humid air.
    *   **Feel:** The boat rocking on the rising and falling waves.
4.  **Acceptance:** Once a clear picture of this inner storm is formed, speak aloud the words: **"I accept the storm within me. I allow the storm within me."**
5.  **Imagination (The Calm):** Begin to imagine the storm subsiding. The rain becomes lighter, the waves calm, the boat steadies, the winds retreat, and the sun breaks through the clouds. As this external scene calms, you should notice the corresponding emotion within you also beginning to subside. The author notes that this step is a "petition and offering to the emotion," not a forceful suppression of it.
6.  **Conclusion:** Once the imagined lake is calm, enjoy the serene environment for a moment before opening your eyes.

Due to its imaginative nature, the author advises against performing this exercise while operating heavy machinery or during other complex tasks.
