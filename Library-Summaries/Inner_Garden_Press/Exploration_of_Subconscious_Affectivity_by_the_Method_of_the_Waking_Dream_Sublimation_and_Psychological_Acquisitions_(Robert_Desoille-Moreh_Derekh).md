# Summary of "Exploration of Subconscious Affectivity by the Method of the Waking Dream" by Robert Desoille

This document details Robert Desoille's pioneering method of the "directed waking dream" (Rêve Eveillé Dirigé or RED) for exploring subconscious affectivity, facilitating psychological acquisitions, and promoting sublimation. The work provides a systematic approach to consciously guiding dream-like states for therapeutic and developmental purposes, aligning closely with the Unified Hermetic Framework's interest in consciousness technology and the disciplined manipulation of inner states for transformation.

## Key Concepts and Observations

### Origin of the Research
Desoille's method stemmed from childhood experiences, particularly a deeply impressive hypnotism session at age seven. This early exposure sparked a lifelong interest in phenomena like mind-reading and induced catalepsy, leading him to investigate the intentional transmission of thought. He later refined these early intuitions into a systematic experimental method.

### The Waking Dream Technique (Schema of Experiments)
The core empirical technique involves:
1.  **Muscular and Psychic Relaxation:** Isolating the subject from external and internal stimuli, often by suggesting pleasant, relaxing scenes or neutral images to dispel preoccupations (e.g., putting cloths in a bag and discarding it).
2.  **Guided Imagery and Suggestion:** Using suggestion to stimulate and orient the imagination. The primary suggestion involves a motor image of **"ascension"** (to achieve sublimation and positive states) or **"descent"** (to explore negative, instinctual aspects). Secondary suggestions are minimized but used to provoke "contrast" and isolate specific affective representations.
3.  **Self-Observation and Analysis:** Subjects are encouraged to describe their visions meticulously. The experimenter's role is to guide the process, help interpret symbolic meanings (often by associating images with personal experiences, avoiding premature interpretations), and facilitate the subject's return to normal consciousness.

### Symbolism and Imagery
-   **"Green Language" and Universal Symbolism:** Desoille emphasizes that the symbolic content of waking dreams acts as a "Green Language," a symbolic means of expression that reveals deeper truths about the subconscious. This symbolism is often universal, connecting to C. Jung's concept of the "collective unconscious" and its primordial images (e.g., angels, archangels, archontes).
-   **Quality of Images:** Images are classified based on their affective quality:
    -   **Real-life Images:** Represent normal consciousness.
    -   **"Low" Images:** Associated with morbid or unpleasant states, often triggered by "descent" suggestions, leading to dread and potentially mental disorders if not carefully managed.
    -   **"High" Images:** Characterized by sublime qualities, often evoked by "ascension" suggestions, leading to euphoria, serenity, and a sense of "purity." These often involve light, harmonious forms, and spiritual beings.

### Psycho-Physiological Effects
Desoille noted measurable physiological changes during sessions, such as decreased respiratory metabolism. He differentiates between voluntary efforts to slow breathing (which increase metabolism) and natural slowing during deep rest (which decrease it), suggesting that the waking dream can induce a state of deep rest that conserves more energy than natural sleep.

### Applications (Psychagogy and Psychotherapy)
The method is applied for:
-   **Self-Education:** Individuals can use the method for mental relaxation, memory recall, and self-suggestion to cultivate desired attitudes or actions (e.g., focusing on light/tranquility before sleep, visualizing success for upcoming tasks).
-   **Psychotherapy:** The method aims to help individuals achieve "psychological acquisitions" and "sublimation." It enables subjects to become aware of latent potentials, reorient instinctual tendencies, and resolve emotional conflicts by confronting and transforming symbolic images.
-   **Memory Enhancement:** Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to recover forgotten memories (hypermnesia) by placing subjects in a passive state of attention.
-   **"Mind-Reading" and Premonition:** Desoille conducted experiments on thought transmission and premonition. While initial experiments on thought transmission had methodological flaws, later experiments with trained subjects showed statistically significant results, suggesting a non-random phenomenon. He emphasizes that premonitions are generally spontaneous, but the method can train subjects to be more receptive to them.

### Pathological Dispositions
Desoille identifies categories of images that indicate psychological difficulties:
-   **Stop Images:** Luminous images that a subject cannot penetrate or move beyond, often accompanied by anxiety, indicating a profound disturbance or neurosis.
-   **Distorting Images:** Images that appear in distorted forms (e.g., pleasant landscapes with dark figures), revealing an inability to maintain affective states corresponding to the visual representation.
-   **Images of Refusal:** Symbolic ties or obstacles representing the subject's unconscious resistance to change or attachment to old habits.
-   **Images of Loneliness:** Visions of barren landscapes or empty spaces, reflecting feelings of isolation or depression.

### Mystical Psychology
Desoille draws parallels between the states induced by the waking dream and mystical experiences, suggesting that the method can provide insight into the psychological mechanisms underlying phenomena like ecstasies and stigmata. He argues that these experiences are often manifestations of the imagination and subconscious processes, rather than purely supernatural events, and that true mystics often achieve sublimation of instinctual desires.

## Relevance to the Unified Hermetic Framework
The systematic exploration of conscious control over inner states, the use of symbolic imagery for psychological transformation, and the investigation of psycho-physiological effects directly supports the Unified Hermetic Framework's goal of integrating esoteric traditions with modern scientific concepts. Desoille's work offers a practical methodology for bridging subjective experience and objective phenomena in the context of consciousness technology.
