    *   **Relevance:** This document details Robert Desoille's method of "directed waking dream" for exploring subconscious affectivity and achieving psychological acquisitions and sublimation. It provides a deeper understanding of how imagination, symbols, and emotions can be consciously directed for therapeutic and developmental purposes, directly supporting the Unified Hermetic Framework's interest in consciousness technology and the disciplined manipulation of inner states for transformation.
    *   **Key Contributions:**
        *   **Method of the Waking Dream:** Introduces and elaborates on a technique that utilizes guided imagery to induce and direct conscious dream-like states for self-analysis and psychotherapy. This method is presented as a means to explore deeper layers of the subconscious, including the "collective unconscious."
        *   **Sublimation and Psychological Acquisitions:** Explores the concept of sublimation as a process of directing instinctive tendencies towards higher, more socially valuable purposes. The method aims to facilitate "psychological acquisitions" – the development of new emotional habits and ways of behaving.
        *   **Critique and Refinement of Psychoanalytic Theories:** While drawing on Freudian and Jungian concepts (e.g., superego, collective unconscious), the author critically examines and refines them based on experimental observations. It emphasizes the importance of active intervention and conscious direction in therapeutic processes.
        *   **Symbolism and Imagery:** Highlights the significance of symbolism in the waking dream, differentiating between images of real life, mythological figures, and abstract light visions. It discusses how these images serve as a "Green Language" for the subconscious and can be used to reveal and process emotional content.
        *   **Psycho-physiological Effects:** Reports on observable physiological changes (e.g., reduced metabolism, slowed breathing) during guided imagery sessions, suggesting a link between mental states and physical processes, which is relevant to the Framework's biophysics and subtle energy interests.
        *   **Training and Application:** Provides practical guidelines for conducting guided imagery sessions, including techniques for relaxation, suggestion, and managing emotional responses. It also discusses the application of the method for both personal development and as a therapeutic tool for neuroses.
