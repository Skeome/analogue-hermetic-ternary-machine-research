# Experimental Protocol: The Seed Experiment

This document outlines a proposed physical experiment to test the core principles of the Ternary Machine theory, building upon the results of the computational model.

## 1. Hypothesis

*   **Primary Hypothesis:** The germination rate and growth pattern of a simple biological system (cress seeds, representing *Salt*) can be measurably and positively influenced by a tuned resonant circuit (representing *Mercury*) that is subjected to a specific, focused intention (representing *Sulfur*).

*   **Null Hypothesis:** There will be no statistically significant difference in germination rate or growth patterns between the seeds in the experimental group and the seeds in the control groups.

## 2. Background

The computational simulation demonstrated a process where a starting state ("Salt") converges towards a target state ("Sulfur") under the influence of a mediating field ("Mercury") [1, 2]. This experiment aims to determine if this convergence can be replicated in a physical, biological system.

The "Tuning" of the Mercury-circuit is analogous to the `mercury_matrix` in the simulation. The "Intent" of the operator is the `sulfur_vector`. The seed's biological state is the `salt_vector`. The "force" that moved the Salt vector in the simulation exists as a real-world, measurable phenomenon.

In traditional alchemical understanding, Sulfur corresponds to the essential oils (the soul or vitality), Mercury to alcohol (the spirit or medium), and Salt to the purified mineral salts (the body or physical manifestation) [3, 4, 5]. This experiment seeks to explore if a similar correspondence holds in the energetic influencing of a biological system.

## 3. Materials

*   **Salt (Witness):**
    *   Cress seeds (*Lepidium sativum*), approximately 500, to ensure statistical validity across groups.
    *   30x sterile 90mm petri dishes.
    *   Sterile cotton wool as a neutral growth medium.
    *   Distilled water.

*   **Mercury (Medium):**
    *   Components for a simple RLC resonant circuit (resistors, inductors, capacitors).
    *   A variable capacitor to allow for manual "tuning" of the circuit's frequency.
    *   Optional: A small, clear quartz crystal and/or a hand-wound Mobius coil to act as a focal point.
    *   Low-voltage power source (e.g., 9V battery).

*   **Sulfur (Input/Intent):**
    *   Primary method: A dedicated human operator focusing a consistent, specific intention (e.g., "optimal, rapid, and vital growth").
    *   Secondary method (for control variation): A function generator producing a specific frequency (e.g., 528 Hz, often associated with healing), or a device playing a recorded mantra.

*   **Control & Measurement:**
    *   A light- and temperature-controlled environment (e.g., a grow tent, incubator, or isolated shelf with consistent artificial lighting).
    *   Digital camera for daily time-lapse photography of all groups.
    *   Digital calipers or a millimeter ruler for measuring sprout length.
    *   A detailed logbook (digital or physical), structured to record: Date, Time, Operation, Materials, Quantities, and Pictures (or references to pictures).

## 4. Procedure

*   **Setup:**
    1.  Label the 30 sterile petri dishes into three groups of 10: "Experimental Group", "Control Group A", and "Control Group B".
    2.  Evenly distribute an equal amount of sterile cotton wool (or blotter paper) into each dish.
    3.  Carefully place an identical number of cress seeds (e.g., 15-20 seeds) into each dish, ensuring even spacing.
    4.  Moisten the cotton wool in all 30 dishes with precisely the same measured amount of distilled water.
    5.  Arrange the dishes within the controlled environment:
        *   **Experimental Group (10 dishes):** Position these dishes immediately surrounding the activated "Mercury" device.
        *   **Control Group A (10 dishes):** Place in a separate, shielded area within the controlled environment, as far as practically possible from any device. This group controls for general environmental factors.
        *   **Control Group B (10 dishes):** Position these dishes immediately surrounding an identical, but *unpowered* "Mercury" device. This group controls for potential passive effects of the device's physical components or geometry.

*   **Execution (Daily for 7 days):**
    1.  **Intent Session (15 minutes):** At a consistent time each day, the designated human operator will sit in front of the Experimental Group. During this 15-minute period, the "Mercury" device for the Experimental Group will be powered on, and the operator will focus their specific, consistent intention (e.g., "optimal, rapid, and vital growth").
    2.  **Control Group B (Passive Exposure):** The unpowered "Mercury" device associated with Control Group B will remain unpowered throughout the experiment. No focused intent will be directed at this group by the operator.
    3.  **Visual Inspection & Photography:** After the Intent Session, all 30 dishes will be visually inspected. Digital photographs will be taken of each dish from a consistent angle and distance.
    4.  **Qualitative Observations:** Any notable observations regarding germination, color, health, or unusual patterns in any group will be recorded in the logbook.

*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Day 0:** Initial setup, moistening, and arrangement of all dishes.
    *   **Days 1-7:** Daily Execution steps (Intent Session, Inspection, Photography, Qualitative Observations).
    *   **Day 7 (Final Measurement):** Detailed quantitative measurements will be taken.

## 5. Data Collection & Measurement

To rigorously test the hypothesis, the following data points will be collected:

*   **Quantitative Data:**
    1.  **Germination Count (Daily):** The number of seeds that have visibly germinated in each of the 30 petri dishes will be counted and recorded daily.
    2.  **Sprout Length (Day 7):** On the final day, the length of the longest sprout in each dish will be measured in millimeters. For a more robust dataset, the average length of a random sample of 5 sprouts per dish will also be calculated.
    3.  **Biomass (Optional, Day 7):** If equipment is available, the total wet mass of the sprouts from each dish can be measured to provide an indicator of overall growth.

*   **Qualitative Data (Daily):**
    1.  **Photographic Record:** A high-resolution photograph of each petri dish will be taken daily from a consistent angle and distance to create a visual time-series of the experiment.
    2.  **Visual Vitality Assessment:** Assess and record subjective observations on the color, turgor (firmness), and overall health appearance of sprouts in each dish (e.g., "vigorous", "average", "weak", "discolored").
    3.  **Smell Assessment:** Note any changes in the ambient smell around each group, as subtle olfactory cues can indicate progress or stagnation in alchemical work.
    4.  **Growth Pattern Observations:** Any notable patterns in growth direction (e.g., growing towards or away from the device), uniformity, or other morphological anomalies will be noted and sketched if necessary.
    5.  **Operator's Log:** The operator will maintain a private log detailing their subjective experience during the intent sessions, including their level of focus, any intuitive feelings, unusual observations, and any notable dream activity or psychic insights occurring during the experimental period.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

Based on the primary hypothesis, we anticipate the following outcomes, which will be evaluated against the null hypothesis:

*   **Primary Quantitative Outcome:** The Experimental Group will show a statistically significant increase in the mean germination count per dish when compared to both Control Group A and Control Group B. Statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) will be used to determine significance.

*   **Secondary Quantitative Outcome:** The Experimental Group will demonstrate a statistically significant increase in mean sprout length and/or total biomass compared to the control groups, suggesting enhanced growth and vitality.

*   **Primary Qualitative Outcome:** The daily photographic record and logbook entries for the Experimental Group will show a consistently higher rating for "visual vitality" (e.g., healthier color, more robust appearance, less incidence of mold or wilting) compared to the control groups.

*   **Secondary Qualitative Outcome:** Analysis of the photographic record may reveal non-random growth patterns in the Experimental Group (e.g., a subtle directional tropism, or more uniform growth towards a specific point), which should be absent or less pronounced in the control groups.

*   **Exploratory Outcome:** The Operator's Log may contain entries that correlate with significant measurable changes in the Experimental Group (e.g., a session of intense focus correlating with an accelerated growth spurt), providing preliminary qualitative evidence for the influence of subjective intent.
