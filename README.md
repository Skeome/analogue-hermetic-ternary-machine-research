# Ternary Machine Project

## Project Overview

This project, "The Ternary Machine," explores the integration of esoteric traditions—such as Hermeticism, alchemy, and Qabalah—with modern scientific concepts in biophysics, quantum mechanics, advanced materials science, and consciousness technology. It posits a "Unified Hermetic Framework" as a theoretical foundation for understanding and potentially interacting with subtle energy, treating concepts often labeled as "pseudoscience" as legitimate scientific data awaiting appropriate measurement instruments.

The core objective is to lay the theoretical and computational groundwork for the development of "consciousness technology," including Radionics, Psionics, and future quantum-esoteric interfaces. This involves developing models for phenomena like the "Spiritus Mundi" (World Spirit) and the "Tria Prima" (Sulfur, Mercury, Salt) within a rigorous, scientifically-oriented framework.

## Key Project Documents

*   **`Thesis-Statement.md`**: The foundational document outlining the "Unified Hermetic Framework," covering the ontology of the "One Thing," the structural triad of "Tria Prima," the Qabalistic model, biophysics of the human energy field, applied esoterics (Radionics/Psionics), and advanced synthesis.
*   **`Research-Study.md`**: Expands upon the `Thesis-Statement.md` by integrating new research into the mechanics of Radionic machines, conceptual models for Simple Analogue Ternary Machines, quantum states in materials like graphene, and the theoretical basis for room-temperature Qutrit-based Quantum Computers.
*   **`Ternary-Logic.md`**: Details the principles of ternary logic, its conceptual benefits, and an outline for creating an analogue ternary machine, with a specific focus on the 0-state as a receptor for consciousness signals.
*   **`Computational-Model.md`**: Provides the design for a computational simulation of the Ternary Machine, mapping esoteric principles to Python/NumPy constructs for modeling and visualization.
*   **`ternary_simulation.py`**: The Python script implementing the computational model described in `Computational-Model.md`, featuring a 3D animated visualization of subtle energy interactions.

## Library

The `Library/` directory contains a comprehensive collection of source materials, including PDFs and documents, organized by topic (e.g., Alchemy, Channeled Material, Occult/Esoteric, Science). This repository supports the theoretical framework and research conducted within the project.

## Running the Simulation

The project includes a Python-based simulation that models the interaction of the alchemical primes (Sulfur, Mercury, Salt) in an N-dimensional state space.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Setup

1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Execution

To run the simulation and see the 3D animated visualization:

```bash
python ternary_simulation.py
```

This will open a real-time plot window displaying the "Salt" state converging towards the "Sulfur" target, influenced by the "Mercury" medium. Close the window to end the simulation.
